## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Speech-to-Text**: Convert spoken language into text in real-time
- **Audio Visualization**: Visual microphone intensity meter with color indicators
- **Adjustable Recording Duration**: Set recording segments from 1-10 seconds
- **Persistent Transcription History**: Timestamped transcript entries
- **Modern Dark UI**: Clean, intuitive interface built with CustomTkinter
- **GPU Acceleration**: Uses CUDA when available for faster processing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A working microphone

### Installation

No manual installation of dependencies required! The application will automatically install all necessary packages on first run.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-transcription-app.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd speech-transcription-app

# Run the application
python app.py
```

The first run may take a few minutes as the application downloads the speech recognition model (~500MB).

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Adjust the recording duration using the slider (default: 5 seconds)
3. Click "Start Recording" to begin continuous transcription
4. Speak into your microphone

6. Click "Stop Recording" to end the session
7. Use "Clear Transcript" to reset the transcription history

## üîß Technical Details

The application uses:

- Distil Whisper: A lightweight, high-performance speech recognition model
- PyTorch: For machine learning operations
- SoundDevice: For audio recording
- CustomTkinter: For the modern UI components
- Matplotlib: For audio visualization

Models are cached locally to avoid repeated downloads.
